## What You'll Learn

- Fundamentals of blockchain technology and Cardano's eUTxO model
- Setting up a complete Cardano development environment
- Writing smart contracts with Aiken
- Building transaction logic with cardano-cli and Mesh SDK
- Creating full-stack dApps with frontend integration
- Deploying and optimizing smart contracts on Cardano

## Course Structure

This course is divided into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Cardano Fundamentals & Developer Environment Setup** - Understand blockchain basics, Cardano architecture, and set up your development environment
2. **Smart Contract Development with Aiken** - Master the Aiken language and create validators and minting policies
3. **Transactions & Off-Chain Code** - Build transactions and integrate with frontends using Mesh SDK
4. **Building a Complete DApp on Cardano** - Apply all skills to create a fully functional decentralized application

Each module contains explanations, code examples, and links to additional resources. While this learning center can be used as a self-paced course, we also offer live workshops covering this material with hands-on guidance.

## Why Build on Cardano?

Cardano offers significant advantages for blockchain developers:

- **Research-Driven Development**: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal methods
- **Energy Efficiency**: Uses a fraction of the energy of proof-of-work blockchains
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Predictable and affordable transaction costs
- **Native Asset Support**: Create tokens without complex smart contracts
- **Scalability Solutions**: Hydra and other layer-2 solutions for high throughput
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Expanding community of developers and users
